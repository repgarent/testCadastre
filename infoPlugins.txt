Copy the entire directory containing your new plugin to the QGIS plugin directory
cp -R /home/rep/Documents/test /home/rep/.qgis2/python/plugins

Compile the ui file using pyuic4
pyuic4 -o ui_test.py ui_test.ui 

Compile the resources file using pyrcc4
pyrcc4 -o resources_rc.py resources.qrc

Test the plugin by enabling it in the QGIS plugin manager
Customize it by editing the implementation file test.py
Create your own custom icon, replacing the default icon.png
Modify your user interface by opening test.ui in Qt Designer (don't forget to compile it with pyuic4 after changing it)
You can use the Makefile to compile your Ui and resource files when you make changes. This requires GNU make (gmake)
